 * @property BoundedStaleness Bounded Staleness guarantees that reads are not too out-of-date. This can \
 * be configured based on number of operations (MaxStalenessPrefix) or time (MaxStalenessIntervalInSeconds).
 * @property Session          Session Consistency guarantees monotonic reads (you never read old data, \
 * then new, then old again), monotonic writes (writes are ordered)
 *                               and read your writes (your writes are immediately visible to your reads) \
 * within any single session.

 *                          will be eventually be available for reads.
 * @property ConsistentPrefix ConsistentPrefix Consistency guarantees that reads will return some prefix \
 * of all writes with no gaps.
